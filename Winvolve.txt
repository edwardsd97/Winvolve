================
A simple experimentation tool to explore how life can change form over time 
according to the environment they live within.

 - A creature is represented by a sequence of letters. 
 
 - The environment is also represented by a sequence of letters.

 - When two creatures mate to create a new creature it will contain the same 
   letter sequence as its parents but choosing randomly from one or the other
   as it copies their "genes." Then one new mutation occurs.

 - A mutation consist of only one of the following:
     - Changing a single letter by one value higher or lower in the alphabet.
     - Changing a single letter's case.
     
 - Creatures may only mate with other creatures of the same species and only
   once both creatures have reached maturity.

 - When a creature chooses another to mate with it does so by selecting one
   that most matches itself but also most contrasts with the environment.
   In this way it seeks to mate with those that are most vibrant.

 - While this is going on the creatures are also getting eaten. 
   Creatures are eaten that most contrast with the environment.
   
 - The end result is that the creatures evolve to match their environment
   but also maintain bands of contrast with it to help them stand out for
   mating.
   
Statistics
===============
- Generations: The number of generations that have occured 
   (one generation is complete when each creature has had a chance to die/mate)

- Species Now: The number of different species alive right now

- Species Max: The highest number of differenct species alive at any one
   time throughout history.

- Species Ever: The number of species that have existed throughout history.

- Extinctions: The number of species that have died out completely

- Mass Extinctions: The number of times that all species have died out.
   When this occurs a "Rebirth" is triggered where the last species alive
   is born again with a single mutation but in a new environment and given
   a number of generations to mate without predation. This also happens when
   the simulation first starts but with completely random species.

- Predation Status: Indicates if creatures are being eaten currently or not

Species History
===============
Each time a new species evolves it will appear here as a new row.
Each entry shows a random sampling of that species as well as the environment
it was living it at the time. Each time the environment changes a new entry
is added for each species showing how many generations old that species is.

Controls
===============
- Predation: All predation is a random chance based on how much a creature
  contrasts with the environment. This chance is multiplied with this value
  to allow the intensity of predation to be scaled up or down.

- Procreation: All mating is a random chance based on how much a creature
  contrasts with the environment and also matches its mate. 
  This chance is multiplied with this value to allow the intensity of 
  procreation to be scaled up or down.
 
- Species Match Req: A creature that is the same letter sequence as another
  is considered a 100% match or 1.0 match rating. A rating of 0 would be 
  two creatures that have the exact opposite letters in their sequence.
  (the letter alphabet is treated as a circle where the first and last letters
  are considered adjacent) This value specifies the minimum match rating 
  between two creatures needed in order to mate.
  
- Age of Death: Each generation a creature grows in age. Once it has reached
  this many generations since its birth it dies of old age.

- Age of Maturiry: Each generation a creature grows in age. Once it has reached
  this many generations since its birth it can begin mating with others.
  
- Rebirth Generations: The number of generations the creatures are allowed
  to procreate after a mass extinction without predation.
  
- Min Species Pop: The minimum number of creatures needed that differ too much
  from the rest of that species to define a new species. When this happens
  these new creatures are assigned a new species and can only mate with 
  themselves.
  
- Enviro Change Rate: The number of generations allowed between environment 
  changes. When the environment changes it becomes something completely new
  at random. The environment is always represented along the top of the field.
  When this happens creatures along the border between environments have a
  50% chance to swap places with whatever is on the other side of the border.
  
- Gene Count: The number of gene letters that define any given creature. 
  (changing this value requires the simulation to restart)
  
- Population Rows: The number of creature rows in the field
  (changing this value requires the simulation to restart)

- Population Cols: The number of creature columns in the field
  (changing this value requires the simulation to restart)
  
Buttons:
===============
- Defaults: Resets all controls to their defualt values.
  (clicking this requires the simulation to restart)

- Save: Saves the state of the simulation to disk
  (happens automatically when application closes)

- Load: Loads the state of the simulation from disk
  (happens automatically when application starts)

- Predation: Allows you to toggle predation on and off

- Earthquake: Triggers a change in environment and also
  kills off about 25% of population

- Asteroid: Kills all creatures and triggers a mass extinction rebirth

Menu
===============
- File -> Stats : Cycles the display mode between three states

	- Full stats: All controls are displayed	
	- No stats: Only the field of creatures are displayed	
	- Only stats: Use this mode to increase the speed of the simulation	  

- File -> Predation : Same as Predation button

- File -> Earthquake : Same as Earthquake button

- File -> Asteroid : Same as Asteroid button

Some things to try
===============
- Turn off predation and watch as the creatures quickly evolve to contrast 
  with the environment. Then turn it back on and watch them die out quickly
  as they all stand out like sore thumbs.
  
- Change the number of genes and see how that affects the rate of evolution.
  Try to find the right level of predation and procreation so that creatures
  do not die out completely too often but still evolve quickly from one
  environment to the next.
